    <h1>Nath Operations</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      In Js we can use many Math Operation <br />
      such as: <br />
      1. Arthmethic: + (addition), - (substraction), * (mutiplication), **
      (exponential), / (division), % (modulo) <br />
      2. Augmented Assignments: operation by itself (see my Js code)<br />
      3. Unary: Different with some others 2 before that need at least 2 value,
      <strong>Unary only need 1 value of data</strong> <br />
      : + (tell that the number is positive, normally we dont do that cause it's
      default), - (tell the number is negative), ++ (increment, add 1 number)
      (it's the most effective form of addition than arithmethic or unary), --
      (decrement, same like increment but decrease 1 num) 4. etc
