      Array: Bunch of Data. <br />
      Array in Js is dynamic, that means we can edit it (add some data as much
      as we want), not like Java when we need to has the long of array and it's
      fix. <br />
      <strong>How to create it?</strong>
      Use [] for empty array <br />
      Use ["data1", "data2", "data3"] for array with value inside
      <br />
      <strong>How array works?</strong> <br />
      1. Start from 0 <br />
      2. The data that added always come to the end or last of the queue <br />
      3. queue in array called index <br />
      <br /><br />
      <strong>How to edit an array?</strong> <br />
      1. arrayName.push : add <br />
      2. arrayName.length : get array length <br />
      3. arrayName[index]: get the position index of the data <br />
      4. arrayName[index] = value : change the data from that position <br />
      5. delete arrayName[index] : delete the data in that index position,
      <strong>
        it's only delete the data, the index still there, in case you gotta have
        some others data value in the future</strong
      >
      <br /><br /><br />
      in Js we can have array in array (multidimension array)
