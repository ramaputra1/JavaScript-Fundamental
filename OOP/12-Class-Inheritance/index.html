    <h1>Class Inheritance</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      We use class Inheritance when we want to inherit or have the same value as
      other class in our new class and also we can add some value as well in our
      class and it will goes to each prototype from the lowest to the highest
      (object) <br />
      To do the inherit class we use keyword <i>extends</i>
    </p>
