    <h1>Method in Class</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Actually we can add an method (function in class or object) either in our
      constructor or class, but the reccomendation is in class not constructor
      <br />
      because when we add it in constructor it will stick to the instance
      object, but it's better to stick it in our prototype and how we do that is
      to put it in class not constructor
    </p>
