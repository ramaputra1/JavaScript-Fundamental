    <h1>Prototype</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      We use a lot or almost everytime use it in Js: Prototype <br />
      Prototype relate to Inheritance <br />
      Everytime we make a <i>constructor function</i> we always automatically
      create the prototype of it, <br />
      let say we make a constructor function <i>Person</i> it will automatically
      create <i>Person.prototype</i> <br />
      When we make an object, automatically that object is inherit from the
      Constructor.prototype <br />
      To access it we use <i>__proto__</i> <br /><br /><br />
      What is this for: <br />
      We store some method in prototype to make it efficient and we dont store
      it in instance object to save the memory (more efficient) <br />
      then let say if we have <strong>same function's name</strong> in instance
      object and the prototype, when we call that function the one that get call
      is the one in instance object, so it's checking one by one from the parent
      to child
