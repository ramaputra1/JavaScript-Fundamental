    <h1>Static Field</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      As we know if we make a field it will stick to the object <br />
      but if we make it static it will stick to the prototype. <br />
      What is that for? <br />
      It will belongs to the class and it will be global (can access from
      anywhere) <br />
      just put keyword
      <i>static</i> before the field
    </p>
