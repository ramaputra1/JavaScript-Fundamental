    <h1>Super Constructor</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      In Js when you extends or inherit another class that has a constructor
      then in your new class you want another constructor you are
      <strong>need</strong> to declare the previous constructor or the
      constructor from the class that you inherit (the parent) <br />
      how you do that? <br />
      just use keyword <i>super()</i> and inside of () you can put the parameter
      from before class
