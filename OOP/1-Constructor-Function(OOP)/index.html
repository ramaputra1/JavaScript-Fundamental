    <h1>Constructor Function (OOP)</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      In OOP (Object Oriented Programming), here we will begin to works with
      some object data type more complex and effective <br />
      If we only create a usual object with the variable it will make each
      object unique (it means every object have their own characteristic) <br />
      but in OOP we will create a class or blueprint to create all those object
      so it can be similar and more effective <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Actually</strong>: Javascript is not for OOP, it's procedural so
      the base is function <br />
      <br />
      <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
      Started from here till some of file that we will make (3-4 more) we will
      learn how old JS (before ecma 6) works on OOP <br />
      <br />
      In old Js, instead of make a <strong>class</strong> we will make a
      function that called <strong>Constructor Function</strong>
