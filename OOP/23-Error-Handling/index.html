    <h1>Error Handling</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      For anticipate Error Handling we can use <i>try & catch</i> <br />
      Try will find if we have error or not <br />
      Catch will do something with that error <br /><br /><br />
      Actually we have another keyword to use in here, namely: <i>finally</i>
      <br />
      here in <i>finally</i> it will always execute after try and catch <br />
      different with catch, catch only will execute if the try have some error,
      but finally always execute even the try have error or not <br />
      so it will get execute the try, catch then finally for any cases <br />
      also we can straight use try and finally without the catch
