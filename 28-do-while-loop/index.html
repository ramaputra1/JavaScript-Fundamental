    <h1>While Loop</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Siimilar with while loop<br />
      The differences is when it check the condition,
      <strong>While loop at first</strong>, and
      <strong>do while loop</strong> after looping<br />
      so in do while loop even the
      <strong>
        condition is not true, at least once the loop being execute</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      real case: when we want to show the menu, at least once the menu show up
      even the user will close it <br />
