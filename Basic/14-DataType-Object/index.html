    <h1>Object</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      in another program (PHP), we can change the index from number to string
      (associative array), but in Js we can't change that, it's always default a
      number (can not use associative array),<br /><br />
      so, if we want to use a string for the index, we use
      <strong>object</strong>. <br />
      one note: we will change the term <i>index</i> to
      <i>attributes or properties</i> <br /><br />
      then, in array we use <i>[]</i> but in object we gonna use <i>{}</i>
      <br /><br />
      some operators in object are the same like in array, the different is only
      that the index we will change with the properties.
      <br /><br />

      1. arrayName[index] = value : change / add the data from that position
      <br />
      2. delete arrayName[index] : delete the data in that property position
    </p>
