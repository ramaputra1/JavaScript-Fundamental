    <h1>Getter & Setter</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Getter & Setter is another approach to make a
      <strong> function</strong> in object's <strong>property</strong> <br />
      So, in object we can make Getter & Setter, also it can do as much as what
      function can do <br />
      <br />
      1. Getter: Take a data from object's property (No Parameter)<br />
      2. Setter: Change data from object's property <br />
      <br /><br />
      When we use <strong>get</strong> in object, it will count as property
      <br />
