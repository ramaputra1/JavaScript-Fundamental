    <h1>Optional Chaining</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Optional chaining is an operator to help us avoiding error because of
      nullish data. (Happens if we want to access a property that actually is
      nullish from an object)<br />
      If we want to access some property <strong>from nullish data</strong>, it
      will throw an error. <br />
      <strong>So to prevent that we use optional chaining</strong> <br /><br />
      We will use <strong>?</strong> in each property to check
      <strong
        >if this property is nullish, the rest of property will be nullish as
        well.</strong
      >
