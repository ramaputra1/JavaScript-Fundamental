    <h1>typeOf Operator</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      It's an operator to check what is the
      <strong>data type of value or variable</strong> <br />
      <strong>Why need this?</strong> <br />
      JavaScript is a dynamic language, that means that we can have multiple
      data types in one variable array or object, that is why sometimes we use
      <i>typeOf</i> to check what kind of data type of that value in some
      variable. <br />
      <br />
      The output of typeOf would be <i>string</i> that data type. <br />
      <br />
      List of data we can check: <br />
      1. Undefined <br />

      3. Boolean <br />
      4. Number <br />
      5. BitInt <br />
      6. String <br />
      7. Symbol <br />
      8. Function <br />
      9. Except of all of these things it would return: <strong>Object</strong>
      <br />
