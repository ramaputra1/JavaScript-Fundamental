    <p>
      <strong>What is Console?</strong>
      Console it means to use the feature of <strong>logging</strong>, <br />
      What is that? <br />
      It is when you want to tell some information as a programmer such as for
      debugging or even some text, <br />
      but we do not want to show it in the web page (Because that will distract
      or annoy the user), so we use the console feature in web browser to show
      those kind of information.<br />
      <br />
      We can simply click right at mouse and choose inspect then check the
      console. <br /><br />
      <strong>All console that we have:</strong>
      1. console.info() : tell some information <br />
      2. console.warn() : tell some warning information <br />
      3. console.error() : tell some error information <br />
      4. console.table() : tell information in table
