    <h1>String & Number Convertion</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Why we need this convertion?</strong>
      Sometimes the user input gonna be string when we need its supposed to be a
      number, or vice versa. <br />
      That is why when the input's data type does not meet our purpose, we need
      to convert it. <br />
      <br />
      Ways:
      <br />
      1. parseInt(string) = whole number || when you have input (11kk) it still
      will be 11 but when you got (k11) it will be (NaN / Not a Number), so when
      you got number <strong>in front it's fine.</strong><br />
      2. parseFloat(string) = decimal || same like parseInt<br />
      3. Number(string) = whole number or decimal || does not matter when you
      got the number front or back, the value gonna be
      <strong>always NaN</strong><br />
      <br />
      4. number.toString() = number to string<br />

      <br /><br /><br />
      <strong>What is NaN?</strong>
      <br />
      It's a unique data, when you got not a string or not a number, for
      example: (11k), they got both number and character, It's NaN, or even
      <strong> "kkk"</strong> they are in " " and contains no number but char,
      so it's definetely <strong>NaN</strong> <br />
      <strong
        >When you try to do any operation with NaN, the output gonna be always
        NaN</strong
      >

      <br /><br /><br />
      That is why we got a thing to check if it's NaN or not, to prevent the
      wrong output (to be NaN always).
      <br />
      the method is: <strong>isNaN(number)</strong>
