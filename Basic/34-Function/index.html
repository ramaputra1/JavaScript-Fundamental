    <h1>Function</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Block Code Program that we will use. <br />
      In Python you call it "def" <br />
      So the simple way to explain is, function is like variable, it's to store
      somethin, in variable we store data, but in function we store more than of
      that, we store bigger things, then we will call it if we want to use it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Actually, we already use some function from javascript such as: writeln
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>But, How we can make our own function:</strong> <br />
      1. function nameFunction() {} <br /><br />
      <strong> How to call it?</strong> <br />
      nameFunction() <br /><br />
      We can not use space for function name, <br />
      also we need to use <i>camelcase</i> way to write the name of function
