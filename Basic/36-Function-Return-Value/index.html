    <h1>Function Return Value</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      In <strong>default</strong> function is not return any value, but if we
      want to the function to return any value we can do that as well. <br />
      when we use "prompt" or things like that, it was counted as function
      return value. <br />
      function that does not return any value for example is "alert" <br />
      <br />
      <strong>How we can make a function that return any value?</strong> <br />
      Use <strong>return</strong> keyword in that function, then declare
      <strong> what kind of data</strong> that we want to return<br />

      <br />
      But in javascript we only can return <strong>one</strong> data, if we
      wawnt to have multiple data we can use <strong>array</strong> <br />
      <br />
      We can use return keyword more than once with different value
      <br /><br />
      With <strong>return</strong> keyword we also can
      <strong> stop a program </strong>, when the program meet return keyword it
      will stop there, means really stop.<br />
