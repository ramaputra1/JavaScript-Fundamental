    <h1>Variable</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      <br />
      <strong>Why variable?</strong> <br />
      To storing data, so if we need that data we do not need to write them one
      by one, just call it. <br />
      <br /><br />
      Javascript is <i>Dynamic</i> language, that means when you want to declare
      a variable you do not need to tell the program what kind of data type is
      this(like in Java), in Js we can change the data type in variable cause it
      did not require to declare the data type first.
    </p>
    <br /><br />
    First keyword that we can use is <strong>var</strong>. <br />
    In Js like I said earlier, we can change the data in variable just using
    <strong>=</strong> <br /><br />
    How to call: Just type the name of variable combine with the writeln or
    console or other.

    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>CHANGES:</strong> <br />
    After 2015, since ECMAScript2015, we do not use
    <strong>var</strong> anymore, change it into <strong>let</strong> &
    <strong>const</strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>Difference LET & CONST</strong> <br />
    <strong>let</strong>: we can change the value of the variable later. <br />
    <strong>const</strong>: not allowed to change the value of variable.
    (Ussualy for data like the name of app or something that cannot change
    later)<br />
    (constant) <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> <br />
    If you force to change your data value in const variable it will throw an
    error in console, <br />
    and
    <strong
      >if it's throw an error, the rest of your code after the error will never
      be executed</strong
    >, so carefull.
