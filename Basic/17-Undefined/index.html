    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Undefined is one of <strong>Data Type</strong> and one of
      <strong>keyword</strong> in Js. <br />
      It represent a variable that not yet has a value or been initialized
      <br />
      <strong
        >Undefined is different with NULL (in other programming
        language)</strong
      >
      <br />
      <br />
      In another language if it's not yet init it will throw an error (null),
      but in Js it will not, instead of error it will showed an
      <strong>Undefined Data Type</strong>
