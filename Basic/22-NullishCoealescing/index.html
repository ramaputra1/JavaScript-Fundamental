    <h1>Nullish Coalescing Operator</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Nullish</strong> Value is Js are: Null & Undefined. How it works
      is similar with Ternary, but it only for Nullish Value. <br />
      <strong>Only if</strong> the value represent as Null or Undefined, the
      value will be taken. <br /><br />
      We use 2 of ? here, so ??, and we only need one value for if it's a
      nullish value, so do not use <strong>:</strong> <br /><br />
      Real Life situation: <br />
      If we got an value from parameter that give us a Nullish value, we want to
      catch that and change the value. (We catch that using this operator)
