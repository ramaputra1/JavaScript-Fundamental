    <h1>For Loop</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      In for loop, if the consition always satisfied, it will always run. <br />
      syntax:
      <strong>for(init statement;condition;post statement){your block}</strong>
      <br />
      1. Your block: it will always iterate until the condition not satisfied.
      <br />
      2. Init: will execute <strong>once</strong> in first time. <br />
      3. condition: check the condition, if true execute until it false. <br />
      4. post statement: will execute every time in the end of looping (init ->
      condition -> looping -> post statement -> condition -> looping -> post ->
      condition) <br />
      Init statement, condition and post statement is not mandatory, if the
      condition is empty that means it's true.
      <strong>(will never stop)</strong>
