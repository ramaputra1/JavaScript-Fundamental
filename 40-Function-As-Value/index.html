    <h1>Function As Value</h1>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Function in Js is can be store in Variable and use it as a value <br />
      when we store it in variable we do not need to use () after the name of
      function <br />
      because when we use () it means that we <strong>call</strong> the function
    </p>
